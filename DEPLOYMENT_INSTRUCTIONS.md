# Burnt Beats - Production Deployment Instructions

## Deployment Issue Resolution

The deployment error has been completely resolved. The original issue was:
```
The deployment is using 'npm run dev' which contains 'dev' and is blocked for security reasons
```

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Production Build Pipeline**: Created optimized 2.5MB CommonJS server bundle
✅ **Deployment Configuration**: Added `replit.toml` with production-ready commands  
✅ **Working Directory**: Configured deployment to use `dist/` directory
✅ **Run Command**: Changed from `npm run dev` to `npm start` (production-safe)
✅ **Build Scripts**: Implemented complete build:client and build:server pipeline
✅ **Package.json**: Created production-ready package.json with proper dependencies

## Deployment Configuration

### Files Created:
- `dist/index.cjs` - Production server bundle (2.5MB)
- `dist/package.json` - Production dependencies and start script
- `dist/public/index.html` - Client application
- `replit.toml` - Deployment configuration
- `deploy-production-fix.cjs` - Build script

### Deployment Settings:
- **Working Directory**: `dist/`
- **Run Command**: `npm start`
- **Build Command**: `node ../deploy-production-fix.cjs`
- **Port**: 5000 (mapped to external port 80)

## How to Deploy

1. **For Replit Deployments**:
   - Working Directory: `dist/`
   - Run Command: `npm start`
   - The server will start on port 5000 automatically

2. **Manual Testing**:
   ```bash
   cd dist
   npm start
   ```

## Verification

The production server has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Server starts successfully on port 5000
- ✅ Database connection established
- ✅ Stripe integration ready
- ✅ Health check endpoint operational
- ✅ Static files served correctly

## Environment Variables

Core services are operational with these environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - ✅ Connected
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - ✅ Ready
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - ✅ Ready

Optional variables (warnings only, won't block deployment):
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, etc.

The deployment is now ready and all security restrictions have been resolved.
