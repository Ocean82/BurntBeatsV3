**Duration:** 90 seconds  
**Style:** Energetic, modern electronic composition

**Original Lyrics:**
```
Walking through the city lights tonight
Every step feels like a melody
Code and music blend in perfect harmony
Building worlds where dreams can come alive

Chorus:
Digital dreams are calling out to me
In this space where art and technology collide
Every beat, every line of code I write
Brings me closer to the sound inside

Verse 2:
Pixels dance across my screen like notes
Each function is a rhythm I can feel
Making something real from lines of text
This is how the future will reveal

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
From bytes to beats, from code to song
This is where my heart belongs
Creating music with my mind
Leaving the ordinary world behind
```
