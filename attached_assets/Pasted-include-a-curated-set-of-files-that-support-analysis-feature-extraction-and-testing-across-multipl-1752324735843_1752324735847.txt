include a curated set of files that support analysis, feature extraction, and testing across multiple dimensions — especially if you're feeding them into Burnt Beats or pairing them with audio generation workflows. Here’s a breakdown of what that usually includes:

🎵 Core Audio Files
These are your raw materials for MIR analysis.
- WAV / MP3 files at various sample rates and bit depths
- Multi-instrument and multi-genre tracks for diversity
- Isolated stems (e.g., vocals, drums, bass) if available
- Short clips for rapid testing of segmentation and onset detection

📊 Feature Extraction Targets
Include audio content with known annotations so you can evaluate model accuracy.
- Beat annotations (.beats.txt)
- Pitch contours (.pitch.csv)
- Chord progressions (.chords.lab)
- Melody lines (.melody.txt)
- Tempo & rhythm annotations (.tempo.csv)
These help benchmark algorithms against ground truth.

🧠 Precomputed Features
Optional but useful if you want to skip computation during testing.
- MFCCs (.mfcc.npy)
- Chroma features (.chroma.npy)
- Spectral contrast (.spec_cont.npy)
- Onset strength / energy profiles
These can be stored as NumPy arrays or flat CSVs.

🖼️ Spectrogram and Image Representations
If you’re pairing visuals with MIDI or generative mapping:
- Log-mel spectrograms (.png or .npy)
- Constant-Q Transform (CQT) visualizations
- Annotated piano rolls or MIDI maps as images
- Floating point depth variations (like gray32fp_20x15_none.png) to evaluate format sensitivity

🧪 Metadata & Labels
The real power is in structured tags and context.
- Genre classifications (.genre.txt)
- Instrument labels (.instrument.txt)
- Recording info: sample rate, duration, channels
- File descriptors (.json) for automation scripts

🛠️ Utility Scripts (Optional but Handy)
Include parsing tools or loaders:
- Python/R scripts to convert, segment, or visualize
- Feature extractors tied to libraries like LibROSA, Essentia, or PyDub

Would you like help building a starter folder structure for Burnt Beats to incorporate MIR data cleanly? I could whip up a scaffolding layout and sample loader functions if that speeds up your testing. Let’s make this plug-and-play.
